The zip file contains PHP unit test examples and in a sub-folder named simpletest, the 
software SimpleTest (http://www.simpletest.org/).

Installation:

Upload all into a sub-folder on your PHP server space.

Try out the test files in the root folder in approximately this order:

calculator_test1.php
calculator_test2.php
calculator_test3.php
contact_test1.php
contact_test2.php
password_form_test.php

There are also files that run more than one test:

suite.php
run_all.php

View how the files work via a browser then view them internally to see 
how they are put together.
